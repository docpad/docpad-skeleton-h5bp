	templateData:

		site:
			# The production url of our website
			# If not set, will default to the calculated site URL (e.g. http://localhost:9778)

		# -----------------------------
		# Helper Functions

		# Get the prepared site/document title
		# Often we would like to specify particular formatting to our page's title
		# we can apply that formatting here
		getPreparedTitle: ->
			# if we have a document title, then we should use that and suffix the site's title onto it
			if @document.title
				"#{@document.title} | #{@site.title}"
			# if our document does not have it's own title, then we should just use the site's title
			else
				@site.title

		# Get the prepared site/document description
		getPreparedDescription: ->
			# if we have a document description, then we should use that, otherwise use the site's description
			@document.description or @site.description

		# Get the prepared site/document keywords
		getPreparedKeywords: ->
			# Merge the document keywords with the site keywords
			@site.keywords.concat(@document.keywords or []).join(', ')


	# =================================
	# Collections

	# Here we define our custom collections
	# What we do is we use findAllLive to find a subset of documents from the parent collection
	# creating a live collection out of it
	# A live collection is a collection that constantly stays up to date
	# You can learn more about live collections and querying via
	# http://bevry.me/queryengine/guide

	collections:

		# Create a collection called posts
		# That contains all the documents that will be going to the out path posts
		posts: ->
			@getCollection('documents').findAllLive({relativeOutDirPath: 'posts'})


	# =================================
	# Environments

	# DocPad's default environment is the production environment
	# The development environment, actually extends from the production environment

	# The following overrides our production url in our development environment with false
	# This allows DocPad's to use it's own calculated site URL instead, due to the falsey value
	# This allows <%- @site.url %> in our template data to work correctly, regardless what environment we are in

	environments:
		development:
			templateData:
				site:
					url: false


	# =================================
	# DocPad Events

	# Here we can define handlers for events that DocPad fires
	# You can find a full listing of events on the DocPad Wiki

	events:

		# Server Extend
		# Used to add our own custom routes to the server before the docpad routes are added
		serverExtend: (opts) ->
			# Extract the server from the options
			{server} = opts
			docpad = @docpad

			# As we are now running in an event,
			# ensure we are using the latest copy of the docpad configuraiton
			# and fetch our urls from it
			latestConfig = docpad.getConfig()
			oldUrls = latestConfig.templateData.site.oldUrls or []
			newUrl = latestConfig.templateData.site.url

			# Redirect any requests accessing one of our sites oldUrls to the new site url
			server.use (req,res,next) ->
				if req.headers.host in oldUrls
					res.redirect(newUrl+req.url, 301)
				else
					next()
